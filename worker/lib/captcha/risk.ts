 *
 *  SOFT SIGNALS — each adds a weighted score; NO single soft signal can reach
 *  the default block threshold (60) alone, by construction every weight < 60.
 *  This is the false-positive guard the design demands: a Linux desktop, a
 *  privacy browser, a keyboard-only user, a screen-reader user, a slow network
 *  or a missing touch screen must never be punished — none of those are even
 *  inputs here. Only the physics of the interaction itself is scored.
