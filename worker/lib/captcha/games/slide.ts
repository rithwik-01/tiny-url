/**
 * Slide to the notch — the v2 favourite, back as a v3 plugin. Drag the handle
 * along a track until it sits in the marked notch. The target is necessarily
 * shown (you have to aim at it), so — like sort-by-size — the answer is
 * structural, not secret; the moat is identical to every other game: a
 * proof-of-work per attempt, a single-use challenge, and a REAL drag that
 * actually travels to the notch (a teleport with no movement fails). Works with
 * a pointer or the arrow keys.
