# Deployment guide

A complete, copy-paste walkthrough to take Tiny URL from zero to a live site on your
own domain. It runs on the **Cloudflare Workers free plan** — no monthly cost for a
normal-sized install.

> **The short version:** click the **Deploy to Cloudflare** button — it clones the repo,
> auto-creates the D1 database + KV + R2, and sets up CI/CD. Add **two** secrets, let the
> first deploy apply the schema, open the app, create the admin. Custom domain + Postgres
> are optional steps below.

If anything goes wrong, see **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**.

## Fastest path — the Deploy button (D1, one-click)

The repo ships preconfigured for **D1** (Cloudflare's built-in SQL database), so there's
nothing to provision by hand:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/rithwik-01/tiny-url)

Clicking it will:

1. **Clone** this repo into your GitHub account.
2. **Auto-provision** the D1 database, KV namespace and R2 bucket and bind them to your Worker
   (the binding ids are written in the dashboard — `wrangler.jsonc` ships without them on purpose).
3. **Configure Workers Builds (CI/CD)** — every push to your production branch builds + deploys.

Then finish in three steps:

1. **Add the two secrets** — in *Workers & Pages → your worker → Settings → Variables & Secrets*:
   `SESSION_SECRET` (a long random value, **≥ 32 bytes** — `openssl rand -hex 32`) and `SETUP_TOKEN`.
2. **Make sure the schema is applied.** `npm run deploy` applies the D1 migrations automatically
   (`scripts/postdeploy.mjs`). If your Workers Builds **Deploy command** is a bare `wrangler deploy`,
   set it to **`npm run deploy`**, or apply the schema once with `npm run db:migrate:d1`.
3. **Open your `https://tiny-url.<subdomain>.workers.dev` URL** and complete the **`/setup`** installer
   (creates the admin). Then set the **`APP_URL`** *environment variable* (in *Settings → Build →
   Variables*) to that URL — or your custom domain — and redeploy, so every displayed short link shows
   the right address. You don't edit any file for this; see **[CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md](CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md)**.

Want your **own domain** or **Postgres** instead of D1? Follow the manual steps below — they cover
both, plus *Always Use HTTPS* and member custom domains.

---

## Before you start

You need:

- **Node.js 22+** and **npm**
- A **Cloudflare account** with your domain added as a **zone** (free plan is fine)
- **`npx wrangler login`** — authorizes the CLI to create resources and deploy
- A **database** — either:
  - **Cloudflare D1** (recommended for simplicity — it's on Cloudflare, no external server, $0), or
  - **Postgres** reachable from Cloudflare (e.g. a managed provider or your own server, via Hyperdrive)

Pick the database now; the steps differ slightly and are labelled **[D1]** / **[Postgres]**.

---

## Step 1 — Install and configure local secrets

```bash
git clone <your-repo> tiny-url && cd tiny-url
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

`.dev.vars` is the **one local config file** (gitignored). It's read by both `npm run dev`
and the migration tool. Open it and set:

```ini
# A long random string. The app REFUSES TO START if this is under 32 bytes.
SESSION_SECRET="<paste: openssl rand -hex 32>"

# Any random token — you'll type it once on the first-run /setup screen.
SETUP_TOKEN="<paste: openssl rand -hex 16>"

# [Postgres only] Local dev points Hyperdrive straight at your database.
# Use sslmode=disable only for a local DB; use require for a real one.
CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE="postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:5432/DB?sslmode=require"
```

> **Generate strong secrets.** `openssl rand -hex 32` gives a 64-char value (32 bytes) —
> well above the minimum. Never commit `.dev.vars` or paste real secrets into chat.

---

## Step 2 — Provision Cloudflare resources

**You can skip this step.** `wrangler.jsonc` ships the KV, R2 and D1 bindings **without ids**, so
on your first `npm run deploy` Wrangler [auto-provisions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#automatic-provisioning)
them and links them to your Worker — same as the Deploy button.

Prefer to create them by hand (e.g. to reuse existing resources)? Run:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create LINKS_KV       # paste the id into kv_namespaces[0].id
npx wrangler r2 bucket create tiny-url-logos   # bound by name; nothing to paste
```

(Ids are not secrets — commit them. Leaving them out and letting auto-provisioning fill them in
is the recommended path.)

---

## Step 3 — Pick your database

### Option A — Cloudflare D1 (the default, fully on Cloudflare) **[D1]**

**Nothing to do — this is already configured** (`"DB_DRIVER": "d1"` + the `d1_databases` block).
The database is auto-created on your first deploy, and `npm run deploy` applies the migrations for
you via `scripts/postdeploy.mjs`. To apply the schema on its own, run `npm run db:migrate:d1`.

No Hyperdrive, no external server.

### Option B — Postgres via Hyperdrive **[Postgres]**

Hyperdrive pools and accelerates connections to your Postgres from the edge:

```bash
npx wrangler hyperdrive create tiny-url-db \
  --connection-string="postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:5432/DB?sslmode=require"
```

Then in `wrangler.jsonc`: set `"DB_DRIVER": "postgres"`, **uncomment the `hyperdrive` block** and
paste the returned id. In `worker/env.ts`, flip the binding declarations as the note there says
(make `HYPERDRIVE` required / add `DB?: D1Database` back), then `npm run cf-typegen`. Create the schema:

```bash
npm run db:migrate     # reads .dev.vars, connects directly (not through Hyperdrive)
```

> **Postgres hardening:** restrict the database to [Cloudflare's IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/),
> use a least-privilege role (not a superuser), and keep `sslmode=require`. `sslmode=disable`
> is for local development only.

---

## Step 4 — Set your domain (optional — defaults to `*.workers.dev`)

> **Full walkthrough:** **[CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md](CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md)** covers this in depth, plus
> giving *members* their own domains. This is the quick version.

Out of the box the Worker is served at `https://tiny-url.<subdomain>.workers.dev` and short links
live at `…workers.dev/<slug>`. To use your **own domain**, set **one env var** — `APP_URL` — and
**don't edit any file**:

- **Workers Builds:** *your Worker → Settings → Build → Variables and secrets* →
  `APP_URL` = `https://go.yoursite.com`.
- **Local:** `.dev.vars` (`APP_URL="https://go.yoursite.com"`) or `export APP_URL=…` before deploy.

You don't touch a `routes` block. On deploy, `scripts/apply-domain.mjs` reads `APP_URL` (env →
`.dev.vars` → the `wrangler.jsonc` default), writes it into the Worker's vars, and derives the
route:

- **`APP_URL`** is the canonical origin for every displayed short URL, QR target, and API doc
  (there is **no** separate "short domain" admin setting — it's the single source of truth). Even
  on `*.workers.dev`, set it to that exact URL so links display correctly.
- A `*.workers.dev` host gets **no custom route**; **your own domain** gets a `custom_domain`
  route automatically, and Cloudflare manages its DNS + TLS certificate.

> A custom domain's **zone must be on your Cloudflare account**. Changing the served domain later
> is just updating the `APP_URL` env var and redeploying — it can't be a live runtime setting.

---

## Step 5 — Set the Worker secrets

Local `.dev.vars` doesn't ship. Set the two runtime secrets in Cloudflare once:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET    # paste the SAME long value as in .dev.vars
npx wrangler secret put SETUP_TOKEN       # paste your setup token
```

> `SESSION_SECRET` signs cookies, peppers passwords, and keys the human check — it must be
> **≥ 32 bytes**; the app asserts this on startup and 500s loudly if it's weak or missing.

---

## Step 6 — Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy     # build client + Worker → wrangler deploy → auto-apply D1 migrations
```

On **[D1]** this also applies the schema to the remote database after deploying (via
`scripts/postdeploy.mjs` → `scripts/d1-migrate.mjs`); on **[Postgres]** that step is a no-op.

---

## Step 7 — Turn on "Always Use HTTPS" ⚠️ (don't skip)

In the **Cloudflare dashboard → your domain → SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates**, enable
**Always Use HTTPS**.

The Worker selects its strict security headers (HSTS, CSP) and the cookie `Secure` flag
based on the request being HTTPS. If a plain-HTTP request ever reaches it, those protections
weaken. *Always Use HTTPS* makes Cloudflare upgrade every request at the edge, so the Worker
only ever sees HTTPS. Treat this as a required deploy step.

---

## Step 8 — First-run setup (create the admin)

Open `https://go.yoursite.com`. Because no admin exists yet, you'll see the **`/setup`**
installer (it disappears after setup and can't be re-run — it locks itself atomically):

1. Enter your **`SETUP_TOKEN`**.
2. Pick an app name and brand color.
3. Create the admin email + password.

You're signed in as admin. Registration is **closed by default** — open it anytime from
**/admin → Settings**.

🎉 **Your shortener is live.** Everything below is optional tuning.

---

## Step 9 — Optional: configure in the admin console

All of these are live settings — **no redeploy**:

- **Branding & SEO** — logo, description, OG social card, X/Twitter handle, indexing toggle. The
  Worker auto-builds the page `<head>` (canonical, OG/Twitter cards, JSON-LD) and serves
  `/sitemap.xml` + `/robots.txt` from these.
- **Limits & safety** — blocked destination domains, reserved slugs, link/domain/key quotas,
  rate limits (login, link creation, API), random-slug length, human-check mode & difficulty.
- **Click history retention** — purge raw click rows older than N days to bound the database
  (0 = keep forever). Per-link totals are always preserved. See
  [CONFIGURATION.md → Admin settings](CONFIGURATION.md).
- **Analytics export row cap** — max rows one CSV export returns (default 10,000; 0 disables).
  Owners export a link's clicks; admins export across all links. See CONFIGURATION.md.
- **Custom domains for members** — see below.

### Letting members use their own domains

> **Full walkthrough:** **[CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md → Part 2](CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md#part-2--member-domains)**.
> For the API token, see **[CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md](CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md)**.

Members can serve links from `go.theirbrand.com`. Two modes, picked automatically:

**Automatic — [Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-saas/) (recommended).**
In **/admin → Settings → Custom domains**, paste a **Cloudflare API token** (permission:
*SSL and Certificates → Edit*) and your **Zone ID**. Now a member just adds their domain on the
**Domains** page, points one **CNAME** at the fallback host, and it connects with automatic TLS —
no per-domain work for you, no redeploy. Cloudflare for SaaS includes a free allotment of custom
hostnames, then a per-hostname fee beyond it — see current
[Cloudflare for SaaS pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-saas/).

**Manual / $0 — DNS verification.** Leave the token unset. A member adds their domain and a
`_tiny-url-verify` **TXT** record; the Worker confirms ownership over public DNS-over-HTTPS.
To make a verified domain actually serve traffic, connect it once as a free
[Workers Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).
Best when the domains are on your own Cloudflare account.

A cron (daily, 03:00 UTC) removes domains left unverified past the admin-set window
(**Auto-remove unverified domains**, default 90 days, 0 = never) and frees their Cloudflare
custom hostname.

## Scale & cost — what "$0" really means

| Cloudflare free-plan limit | What hits it | Headroom |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Workers: 100,000 requests/day** | SPA loads, API calls, **every redirect** | The real ceiling — see below |
| KV: 100k reads/day, 1k writes/day | redirect cache | Reads track redirects; writes are tiny (well under) |
| D1 free: 5 GB storage, 5M rows read/day, 100k rows written/day | the clicks table | Use retention to bound it; see [current D1 limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/pricing/) |
| R2: 10 GB | QR logos / uploaded OG images | Plenty |
| Durable Object (rate limiter) | login/API/abuse throttling | On the free plan |

**The honest headline:** the **100k Worker-requests/day** cap is the first wall. That's roughly
a few thousand daily-active dashboard users, *or* ~100k redirects/day — whichever your traffic
leans toward. For genuinely large traffic (10k+ active users, viral links) you'll want the
**Workers Paid plan ($5/month**, which includes 10M requests/month and generous D1/Analytics
limits). No database choice changes this — it's a Workers limit.

**To get the most out of $0:** set a **Click history retention** window so the clicks table
(the only table that grows with traffic) stays bounded, and keep the human check enabled (it
throttles abuse at the edge via a Durable Object, never burning your KV budget).

**Approaching the D1 write cap?** Flip *Admin → Click logging* to **rollup**: clicks are
aggregated hourly through a Durable Object and flushed in batches, so a million clicks become a
handful of D1 writes — no Analytics Engine, no API token, still $0. Trade-off: no unique-visitor
counts or live feed. Pick it before the high-traffic period (modes don't merge history). **D1 only.**

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The repo ships three workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

- **`ci.yml`** — typecheck + build on every PR/push.
- **`bump.yml`** — auto-increments the patch version on each push to `main`.
- **`deploy.yml`** — builds and deploys on push to `main`; skips cleanly until secrets exist.

Add repo secrets **`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`** (least-privilege: *Workers Scripts → Edit*) and
**`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`** — step-by-step in **[CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md](CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md)**.
Migrations are **not** run in CI (your DB firewall may block the runner) — run `npm run db:migrate`
(Postgres) or `npm run db:migrate:d1` (D1) yourself after a schema change.

---

## Updating after a schema change

When `worker/db/schema.ts` changes, generate **both** dialects' migrations and apply them:

```bash
npm run db:generate            # Postgres migration
npm run db:generate:sqlite     # D1/SQLite migration (always do both)

# then apply to whichever DB you run:
npm run db:migrate       # [Postgres] reads .dev.vars, connects directly
npm run db:migrate:d1    # [D1] resolves the auto-provisioned id, applies --remote
```

> **[D1]** Use `npm run db:migrate:d1` (not a bare `wrangler d1 migrations apply … --remote`).
> Because the one-click config omits the `database_id` for auto-provisioning, the bare command
> fails with *"missing a database_id"* — the script resolves the id for you. `npm run deploy`
> already runs this automatically after deploying. If you belong to **more than one Cloudflare
> account**, first `wrangler login` or `export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<id>` so the lookup isn't
> ambiguous.

Then `npm run deploy`. See [ARCHITECTURE.md → Database](ARCHITECTURE.md#database--dual-dialect)
for why both schemas are kept in lockstep.
