# Custom domains

A complete, plain-English guide to serving Tiny URL on a real domain — both the
**app's own domain** (e.g. `go.yoursite.com`) and **your members' domains**.

There are **two completely separate things** people mean by "custom domain". Read the
one-line test below and jump to the right section — mixing them up is the #1 source of
confusion.

| You want… | That's a… | Go to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The whole app (dashboard + your links) to live on `go.yoursite.com` instead of `*.workers.dev` | **App domain** | [Part 1](#part-1--the-apps-own-domain) |
| Each member to run *their* links on *their own* `go.theirbrand.com` | **Member domain** | [Part 2](#part-2--member-domains) |

> **Where the domain's DNS must live — depends on the mode:**
> - **App domain (Part 1)** and **member domains in DNS-verification mode (Part 2B)**: the
>   domain's **zone must be on a Cloudflare account you control** (added to Cloudflare,
>   nameservers pointed at Cloudflare), because you route it as a Workers Custom Domain. Adding
>   a site to Cloudflare is free — *Add a site* in the dashboard, then update nameservers at
>   your registrar.
> - **Member domains via Cloudflare for SaaS (Part 2A)**: the **member's domain does NOT need to
>   be on Cloudflare** — they keep their existing DNS provider and just add one **CNAME** to your
>   fallback host. Only *your* app zone (the one the API token + Zone ID point at) is on
>   Cloudflare.

## Part 1 — the app's own domain

This points the entire app at one hostname you own. Example used throughout: **`go.yoursite.com`**.

Under the hood this uses a **[Workers Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/)** —
Cloudflare connects your Worker to the hostname and **creates the DNS record and the TLS
certificate for you**. You do not touch DNS or manage certs by hand.

### 1.1 — Check the zone is on the right account

The Worker is deployed on one Cloudflare account; the domain's zone must be on the **same
account**. Confirm `yoursite.com` shows up in that account's site list. If the zone is on a
*different* account than the Worker, move the Worker or the zone so they match — a Workers
Custom Domain cannot cross accounts.

### 1.2 — Set one **env var**: `APP_URL` (no file editing)

Set an `APP_URL` environment variable to your domain (full URL, with `https://`) — you do **not**
edit `wrangler.jsonc`:

- **Deploying via Workers Builds (the Deploy button):** *Workers & Pages → your Worker → Settings →
  Build → Variables and secrets* → add `APP_URL` = `https://go.yoursite.com`.
- **Deploying locally:** put it in `.dev.vars` (`APP_URL="https://go.yoursite.com"`) or
  `export APP_URL=https://go.yoursite.com` before `npm run deploy`.

That's it — **you touch no `routes` block and no `wrangler.jsonc`**. On deploy,
`scripts/apply-domain.mjs` reads `APP_URL`, writes it into the deployed Worker's vars, and derives
the route from its host:

- a `*.workers.dev` host → no custom route (served on the workers.dev subdomain);
- your own domain → a `{ pattern: <host>, custom_domain: true }` route, so Cloudflare serves the
  Worker there and **auto-manages its DNS + TLS certificate**.

So `APP_URL` is the single source of truth for both **what links display** (every short URL, QR
target, OG card, API doc) **and where the Worker is served**. The `APP_URL` in `wrangler.jsonc` is
only the shipped default (a `*.workers.dev` URL); the env var overrides it without a code change.

### 1.3 — Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

On deploy, Cloudflare provisions the custom hostname: it adds the DNS record and requests a
TLS certificate automatically. The first request may take a minute or two while the
certificate is issued — a brief "not secure" / SSL error right after deploy is normal; wait
and retry.

> **Deploying through Workers Builds (CI) instead of locally?** Same result — set `APP_URL` as a
> build **Variable** (not a file edit); `apply-domain.mjs` runs in the CI deploy and provisions the
> custom domain. Just push to your production branch.

### 1.4 — Turn on "Always Use HTTPS" (required)

In **Cloudflare dashboard → `yoursite.com` → SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates**, enable
**Always Use HTTPS**. The Worker hardens its headers/cookies based on the request being
HTTPS; this makes Cloudflare upgrade every request at the edge. See
[DEPLOYMENT.md → Step 7](DEPLOYMENT.md#step-7--turn-on-always-use-https--dont-skip).

### 1.5 — Verify

```bash
curl -sI https://go.yoursite.com/api/health   # expect HTTP/2 200
```

Then open `https://go.yoursite.com` in a browser. Create a test link and confirm it shows
`go.yoursite.com/<slug>` (proof `APP_URL` is right) and that the slug redirects.

### Alternative: add it from the dashboard

You can also connect the domain from the UI:
**Workers & Pages → your Worker → Settings → Domains & Routes → Add → Custom Domain**
(the dashboard also has a dedicated **Domains** tab). If you do, **still set the `APP_URL` env var**
to that host so displayed links use it. The env-var path is the recommended one anyway — it both
fixes the displayed origin *and* derives the route on every deploy, with no file to edit and no
dashboard step to remember.

### Changing the app domain later

It's a deploy-time value, not a live runtime setting: update the `APP_URL` env var and redeploy. To
go *back* to `*.workers.dev`, set `APP_URL` to the `…workers.dev` URL (or clear the override) and
redeploy — the derived route is dropped automatically.

## Part 2 — member domains

Let each member serve their links from their own hostname (`go.theirbrand.com/<slug>`).
Slugs are unique **per domain**, so the same back-half can exist on the default host and on
every member domain. There are **two modes** — the app picks automatically based on whether
you've configured a Cloudflare API token.

### Mode A — Cloudflare for SaaS (automatic, recommended)

Cloudflare provisions a **custom hostname** + TLS for each member domain automatically. No
per-domain work for you, no redeploy.

**One-time setup (admin):** in **/admin → Settings → Custom domains**, fill in:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Cloudflare API token** | A token with **Zone › SSL and Certificates › Edit**. See **[CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md](CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md)**. |
| **Zone ID** | The zone the custom hostnames attach to (your app domain's zone). Find it on the domain's **Overview** page → API section. |
| **Fallback host** | What members point their CNAME at — defaults to the app's own host. |

**What a member does:** on the **Domains** page they add `go.theirbrand.com`, then create one
**CNAME** record (`go.theirbrand.com → <fallback host>`) at their DNS provider. Cloudflare
issues the certificate and starts serving — usually within minutes.

> **Cost:** Cloudflare for SaaS includes a free allotment of custom hostnames, then a
> per-hostname fee beyond it — the exact figures change, so treat
> [Cloudflare for SaaS pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-saas/) as the
> source of truth. The token is stored as an **admin setting**, not an env secret, so it can be
> rotated in-app with no redeploy.

### Mode B — DNS verification ($0, no token)

Leave the API token blank. Ownership is proven over public DNS; **you** route verified
domains.

**What a member does:** adds `go.theirbrand.com` on the **Domains** page and creates the shown
**`_tiny-url-verify` TXT** record. The Worker confirms ownership over public
DNS-over-HTTPS (it only sees the record once it has propagated).

**What you must still do once per domain:** verification proves ownership but does **not**
route traffic. Connect each verified hostname once as a free
[Workers Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/)
(same mechanism as Part 1) so it actually reaches the Worker with TLS. This mode is best when
the member domains live on **your own** Cloudflare account.

### Housekeeping

A daily cron (03:00 UTC) removes domains left unverified past the admin window
(**Auto-remove unverified domains**, default 90 days, `0` = never) and frees their Cloudflare
custom hostname. Tune per-member quotas under **/admin → Settings → Limits** (*Domains per
member*).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Links display the old `*.workers.dev` (or placeholder) host | `APP_URL` not updated | Set `APP_URL` to your host and redeploy — it's the single source of truth |
| `https://go.yoursite.com` shows an SSL/"not secure" error right after deploy | Certificate still provisioning | Wait 1–2 min and retry; Cloudflare issues it automatically |
| Custom domain returns Cloudflare error 1016 / won't resolve | Zone not on the Worker's account, or route not deployed | Confirm the zone is on the **same account**; make sure `APP_URL` is your domain and redeploy (the route is derived from it) |
| Cookies don't stick / headers look weak on the custom domain | Worker is seeing plain HTTP | Enable **Always Use HTTPS** (Part 1.4) |
| Member domain won't verify (DNS mode) | TXT not propagated / wrong value | Re-check the exact `_tiny-url-verify` name+value in the app; wait for DNS |
| Member domain verifies but shows no cert / won't load (DNS mode) | Verified but not routed | Connect it once as a Workers Custom Domain, or switch to SaaS mode |
| Adding a member domain fails at the API call (SaaS mode) | Token/zone id missing or wrong permission | Set a token with **SSL and Certificates: Edit** + the right Zone ID — see [CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md](CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md) |
