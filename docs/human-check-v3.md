# Human Check v3 — interactive game CAPTCHA

A self-hosted, server-authoritative human-verification layer for sign-in and
sign-up. Turnstile-style lifecycle (challenge → token → siteverify-on-consume).
The default mode is **invisible-first**: a silent proof-of-work + behavioral/
request scoring lets confident-human traffic pass without a game, escalating to
one short game only when the signals are unsure. In **game-only** mode everyone
plays at least one game (no silent pass). No third-party service; nothing on the
client is worth reverse-engineering.

---

## 1. Threat model

**Assets.** Account creation and login (the protected actions). The attacker's
goal is to pass the check at scale (mass fake sign-ups, credential stuffing).

**Attacker capabilities — assumed.** The attacker can:

- Read every byte the client receives (the challenge JSON, the React bundle).
- Modify any client code, hook the runtime, and replay/forge any HTTP request
  (Burp, mitmproxy, a Python `requests` loop).
- Drive a real browser headlessly (Playwright / Puppeteer / Selenium / raw CDP)
  and dispatch synthetic pointer/touch/key events.
- Compute the "answer" of a rendered game — for any client-rendered puzzle this
  is always possible and we do **not** assume otherwise.

**Explicitly NOT relied upon for security** (these are the things the prompt
calls out): client-side answer checking, Base64 "encoding as protection", JS
obfuscation/minification, disabling right-click, or any single environment
signal (headless / `navigator.webdriver` / Linux / WebView).

**What actually stops abuse — the layered moat:**

| Layer | Property | Defeats |
|---|---|---|
| Opaque tokens | challenge ref + verification token are 256-bit random; only their SHA-256 is stored | token theft from a DB leak; forging a token |
| HMAC bindings | challenge & token bound to action + hostname + caller (IP-HMAC) | using a token for another action/host/session |
| Single-use, atomic | `UPDATE … WHERE consumed_at IS NULL RETURNING` (one statement) | replay; parallel-submit double-spend |
| Short TTL | challenge ≤120 s, token ≤5 min, both admin-set | screenshot farms, precomputation |
| Proof-of-work | SHA-256 leading-zero-bits per challenge; failures escalate the cost ×2 each (capped) | mass automation economics — every attempt burns real CPU |
| Interaction proof | the answer must be supported by recorded pointer/key events (a drag must actually move) | "POST the computed answer" bots; teleport clicks |
| Risk engine | weighted behavioral signals (straight-line, equal-segment, constant-velocity, metronome cadence) | default Playwright/Puppeteer/CDP synthetic input |
| Per-challenge randomization | layout, rule, decoys, **and the shape geometry** regenerate every time; retries rotate the game type | static scripts; precomputed templates; learned single patterns |
| Rate limits | per-IP create/verify caps + per-IP auth throttle | grinding |

No single layer is claimed to be unbreakable. The design goal — the same one
Cloudflare Turnstile states — is to make passing **uneconomical at scale** and
to catch the naive automation that is the bulk of real abuse, while never
blocking a real person.

## 2. Data-flow & trust boundary

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser (untrusted)
    participant W as Worker /api/captcha (trust boundary)
    participant DB as Postgres/D1 (challenge + token store)
    participant A as Auth handler (login/register)

    B->>W: POST /challenge {action}
    W->>W: plan (mode+risk), pick game, generate geometry + SECRET
    W->>DB: insert challenge (refHash, bindings, game incl. secret)
    W-->>B: {ref, pow?, game(public payload only), gamesTotal}
    Note over B: solve PoW in background; play the game;<br/>record compact interaction evidence
    B->>W: POST /verify {ref, powSolution, gameId, answer, evidence}
    W->>DB: load challenge by refHash
    W->>W: check bindings, PoW, hard-fails, risk, game.validate(secret)
    alt more games or retry
        W->>DB: atomic claimChallengeStep (version guard) → next game
        W-->>B: {status:next|retry, game}
    else done
        W->>DB: atomic claimChallengeStep → done; insert verification token
        W-->>B: {status:ok, token}
    end
    B->>A: POST /login|/register {humanToken, …}
    A->>DB: consumeVerification (atomic, single-use) + check bindings
    A-->>B: proceed only if the token redeemed for THIS action/host/caller
```

**Trust boundary = the Worker.** Everything the browser sends is suspect. The
*secret* game state (which object is correct, the target angle, the sort order)
is stored only in the challenge row and never serialized to a response.

---

## 3. "But the bot can read the JSON" — what we do about it

True, and unavoidable in general: to render a game the client must receive
geometry. Two things narrow the gap:

1. **No semantic answer in the payload.** The wire used to carry
   `"shape":"star"`; it no longer does. Each piece ships as a jittered **vertex
   polygon** with no name. To know which piece the prompt ("the star") refers
   to, a script must *visually classify* the outline — and the per-challenge
   radius/angle jitter means "this exact path == a star" can't be precomputed.
   (Honest caveat: classifying a *simple* polygon by counting vertices is cheap.
   This raises the bar from a string compare to perception; it is not a wall.)
2. **Knowing the answer is necessary but not sufficient.** Even with the answer,
   the submission must carry interaction evidence that supports it (a real drag
   that moves; a tap that lands), survive the risk engine, and ride a
   single-use challenge that cost a proof-of-work. That is where the cost lives.

The one game whose answer is structurally in the payload is **sort-by-size**
(the client must render the sizes). It's **off by default** for exactly this
reason; when enabled it relies entirely on the interaction + economic layers —
and on the **accumulated behavioral block** (§8): forged uniform-timing tap
telemetry scores medium every round, so it can never quietly mint on one solve.

---

## 4. How this maps to Cloudflare Turnstile / reCAPTCHA

| Turnstile / reCAPTCHA technique | Here |
|---|---|
| Server-issued challenge, server-side verification (`/siteverify`) | ✅ `/api/captcha/*`; the auth handler "siteverifies" by atomically consuming the token |
| Opaque, single-use response token bound to a sitekey/action | ✅ 256-bit token, single-use, bound to action+hostname+caller |
| Token has a short expiry; reused/expired ⇒ `timeout-or-duplicate` | ✅ ≤5 min, replay ⇒ generic failure (reason logged server-side only) |
| Invisible / managed mode (most users never see a challenge) | ✅ `invisible` mode: silent PoW + risk, escalates to one easy game only when unsure |
| Behavioral / telemetry signals, not a single fingerprint | ✅ ephemeral interaction risk engine; no persistent fingerprint |
| Proof-of-work / client cost (Turnstile ships a PoW) | ✅ admin-set SHA-256 PoW with automatic per-IP escalation |
| Challenge rotation so one solver doesn't generalize | ✅ 6 game types, per-challenge geometry, retries rotate type |
| Accessibility path | ◑ fully keyboard-operable; an audio/alternate non-visual challenge is **not** implemented (see Limitations) |
| Privacy: no permanent device fingerprint | ✅ only ephemeral, per-site, short-TTL abuse counters (hashed IP), no font/canvas/audio fingerprint |

What Turnstile has that a self-hosted layer cannot: Cloudflare's network-scale
**reputation** (IP/ASN history across millions of sites) and private browser
attestation. We approximate the reputation piece with per-IP PoW escalation and
rate limits. That is the honest gap.

---

## 5. Security properties (verified by tests)

- Token sign/lookup, expiry, single-use, and action/hostname/session binding.
- Replay of a completed challenge or a consumed token ⇒ rejected.
- Parallel final submits ⇒ exactly one token (optimistic-concurrency version
  guard + atomic consume).
- Wrong answer, no-interaction, teleport drag, out-of-order or time-reversed
  events ⇒ rejected.
- Naive automation (straight line, equal steps, constant velocity, metronome
  cadence) ⇒ high risk; **no single soft signal** reaches the block threshold,
  so keyboard-only / `webdriver` / Linux / privacy-browser users are not
  blocked.
- Oversized payloads (event flood) ⇒ rejected (zod cap + admin per-challenge
  cap + 64 KB body limit).

Run them:

```bash
npx tsx tests/captcha.ts          # pure unit tests (no DB), runs anywhere
DBURL=postgres://… npm run test:e2e   # includes the DB-backed captcha flow
                                       #   (THROWAWAY DB — e2e wipes all rows)
```

## 6. Configuration (all admin settings — nothing hardcoded)

Admin → Settings → **Human check**. Mode (`disabled` / `invisible` /
`game-only` / `forced-game`), enabled game pool, PoW difficulty, touch
tolerance, challenge/token TTL, retries, max events, risk log/block thresholds,
games-per-challenge, and per-IP create/verify rate limits. Changing any of them
needs no migration (key/value `settings` table) and takes effect within ~8 s
(the hot-path settings memo TTL).

---

## 7. Cost model — staying inside a $0 serverless free tier

The whole design is built to scale to zero and keep the expensive work off the
server:

- **The only heavy compute is the proof-of-work, and it runs in the visitor's
  browser** (a Web Worker with a synchronous SHA-256 loop — `src/lib/sha256.ts`
  + `src/lib/pow.worker.ts`). The server merely verifies one hash. No server CPU
  scales with attacker effort.
- **No per-interaction API calls.** Pointer/key events are batched in the client
  and sent only on submit (`/verify`). The redirect hot path is untouched.
- **Static assets are CDN-cached**; the SPA shell + the tiny PoW worker add a
  few KB.

Per-signup backend cost (success path):

| Resource | Ops / signup | Cloudflare free tier | Headroom |
|---|---|---|---|
| Worker requests | ~3–4 (`/challenge`, `/verify`×N, auth) | 100k/day | ~25k signups/day |
| DB writes (challenge insert + step updates + token insert) | ~3–4 | D1: 100k writes/day | ~25k/day |
| KV writes (rate-limit counters) | ~2 | **KV: 1k writes/day** ⚠️ | ~500/day |

The binding free-tier limit is **KV writes (1k/day)**, consumed by the rate-limit
counters. To stay at $0:

- Keep the human-check `create`/`verify` rate limits **generous or 0** — the real
  throttle is the PoW economics + escalation + the existing per-IP *auth* throttle
  (one shared counter), not these. Each is an admin setting.
- Or run with `DB_DRIVER=d1` and move counters off KV (D1 gives 100k writes/day).
- Challenge/verification rows are purged by the existing daily cron once expired
  (TTL ≤120 s / ≤5 min), so storage stays flat.

Under a flood, the per-IP rate limits + PoW escalation cap the spend; KV/D1
writes are bounded by those limits, and the limiter fails **open** on a quota
blip (never locks real users out — abuse is still gated by PoW + single-use).

## 8. Defense layers added (Turnstile/reCAPTCHA parity, all $0)

Honest ceiling first: a self-hosted layer cannot match their **network-scale
reputation** (cross-site IP/ASN/bot-net history) or be Google/Cloudflare's ML.
Within that limit, these add the same signal *classes* they use — every signal
soft and capped below the block threshold, preserving "no single signal blocks":

- **A — Server request signals** ✅ `worker/lib/captcha/requestSignals.ts`. Free
  `request.cf` (ASN, HTTP protocol) + header coherence (Accept-Language /
  Sec-Fetch / Sec-CH-UA vs the UA). Catches `requests`/`curl` and UA-spoofers
  below the JS layer. Real Chrome/Firefox/Safari/VPN score 0.
- **B — Client env probe** ✅ `src/lib/captcha-probe.ts`. Ephemeral,
  non-fingerprinting: software-WebGL (SwiftShader), `window.chrome`/languages
  anomalies, dwell + did-the-user-interact-first. Catches lazy headless.
- **C — Session behavior** ✅ (folded into the probe) — page dwell + pre-game
  interaction, aggregates only.
- **F — Exact counters via Durable Objects** ✅ `worker/durable/RateLimiter.ts`
  (SQLite-backed, free plan; token bucket; self-cleaning alarm). Strongly
  consistent — no burst/parallel leak. Falls back to KV when unbound.
- **G — Observability + shadow mode** ✅ `captcha_enforce` setting +
  `/api/admin/captcha-stats` (reads live rows, zero writes) + admin panel.
  Score-but-don't-block to tune thresholds on real traffic before enforcing.
- **H — Accessible alternative** ✅ the `key-count` game
  (`worker/lib/captcha/games/keyCount.ts` + `KeyCountGame.tsx`): non-visual,
  keyboard-only, screen-reader friendly, server-validated (count + human
  timing) — not a bypass. Opt in via the "Keyboard-only" link.

**v3+ additions (all $0 — pure CPU / browser / stateless):**
- **Automation-driver markers** ✅ `captcha-probe.ts countAutomationMarkers` — counts
  chromedriver `cdc_`/`$cdc_`, Selenium, Playwright (`__playwright`/`__pw*`),
  Puppeteer, Nightmare, PhantomJS globals + webdriver attributes. Soft (+16),
  capped; a real browser reports 0. Catches the large majority of off-the-shelf
  Selenium/Playwright/Puppeteer that don't strip their markers.
- **Synthetic-event tell** ✅ the recorder records `event.isTrusted`; a stream of
  `isTrusted:false` pointer events is naive `dispatchEvent` automation (+18 soft).
  CDP-driven input is trusted, so this only catches the lazy ones — by design.
- **Client-side success canary** ✅ inert globals (`window.__captchaSolved`,
  `localStorage.captchaPassed`, `data-captcha-status`) that do nothing; if a script
  flips them, the probe reports `clientCanary` and the server treats it as a tamper
  trap (`CLIENT_CANARY_SET`).
- **Honey Game** ✅ `worker/lib/captcha/honey.ts` — a challenge request that trips a
  trap gets a real-LOOKING game whose ref is an **HMAC-signed, expiring honey token**
  (`hcH_…`, **no DB row → $0, flood-proof**); solving it via `/verify` can never mint
  a real token (fail-closed), only logs + escalates. Distinct namespace, impossible to
  confuse with a real `hc1_` ref.
- **All env signals capped at 45** so no single real-user quirk (Linux, VM software-WebGL,
  privacy browser, keyboard-only, VPN) can ever block — behavioral evidence must
  corroborate. Ship new signals with `captcha_enforce=false` (shadow) first.
- **Transport (TLS) cohort soft-bind** ✅ `worker/lib/captcha/transport.ts`. The
  connection's TLS version + cipher (`request.cf.tlsVersion`/`tlsCipher`, free —
  no paid Bot Management/JA3) are HMAC'd into an opaque 16-hex *cohort* captured
  at challenge mint and re-checked at `/verify` and at token consume. A bot that
  solves in a headless browser then redeems from a `requests`/`curl` loop shifts
  cohort (`transport-shift`, +16); a Chromium UA on antique TLS is incoherent
  (`legacy-tls-for-chromium`, +8). Both **soft and capped** (max +24, well under
  the 60 block line) — a genuine reconnect can renegotiate a cipher mid-flow, so
  this never hard-blocks: verify only scores it, consume only logs + escalates the
  next PoW. Only the HMAC is stored/logged, never raw TLS; the cohort is `""`
  (fully inert) without the Cloudflare edge, e.g. local dev. This is the signal
  class — transport below the JS the attacker controls — that Turnstile/reCAPTCHA
  lean on; we approximate it at $0 minus their network-scale reputation. Admin:
  `captcha_transport_bind` (default on).
- **Abuse reputation → risk (Phase E)** ✅ `worker/lib/captcha/reputation.ts`. The
  escalator already makes a grinding IP pay more proof-of-work; this gives the
  *risk score* the same memory so a repeat offender is blocked sooner instead of
  getting a clean slate each attempt. Recent **per-IP** failures (the existing
  `powfail:<ip>` counter) add up to +24; sustained **per-ASN** failures (a new
  `asnfail:<asn>` counter, the cross-IP / network-reputation half) add a weak,
  capped +8 so a shared carrier/VPN ASN with one bot can never punish everyone
  behind it. Both SOFT and well under the 60 block line; the counters only move
  on FAILED checks, so a real visitor (zero failures) scores zero and nothing is
  written on the legitimate pass path. This is the $0 stand-in for the network
  reputation noted as the honest gap in §9. Admin: `captcha_reputation` (default
  on); respects shadow mode like every other signal.

**Anti-fixed-sprite (defeats "hash the rendered sprite once"):** pieces stay procedural —
the server jitters the polygon (±5% + free/k·90° rotation, heart flip) so the vertex list
differs every challenge, and the client rasterizes with a random cell-count (12–14) +
sub-cell offset per piece so the rendered bitmap differs every time too. Same clean,
readable silhouette; a different sprite each challenge. (Honest: a true vertex-count/CV
classifier can still read a star — that residual is covered by the economic + interaction
+ deception layers, not the shapes.) **The piece is NEVER rendered as a shape-named
asset** (e.g. a `/captcha-gems/star.webp` `<image>`): that would leak the answer in the
DOM as a plaintext URL, collapsing perception back to a string compare. The only raster
art is the **decorative full-scene backdrop** (`public/captcha-scenes/*.webp`), chosen by
*game type* (never the secret answer), purely cosmetic, painted over a procedural fallback
and skipped under `Save-Data` — it is no part of validation and leaks nothing.

**Anti-forged-evidence hardening (closes "derive the structural answer + forge benign telemetry"):**
The honest residual above — a script that reads the answer from the payload and
submits *plausible* interaction evidence — is squeezed by three stateless, $0
rules in `service.ts` + `risk.ts`:
- **Accumulated behavioral risk, valid-only.** A correct-but-medium-risk solve no
  longer just earns "one more game"; the *behavioral* component of each VALID
  solve is summed across the games (stored in `humanChallenges.riskScore`), and
  crossing the high line locks the challenge. Forged uniform telemetry scores
  medium every round, so two such rounds block. Static per-request signals
  (request/transport/reputation) are deliberately **not** summed — they recur on
  every request, so accumulating them would slowly punish a steady real user.
  A wrong answer never poisons the accumulator (only correct solves add).
- **No weak final game.** Single-action games (`tap-match`, and the keyboard
  `key-count`) carry almost no behavioral signal — one clean tap/press scores ~0.
  `finalPool` strips them from the *final/solo* slot, so the last puzzle before a
  token always has a real interaction to score (a drag, a 3-tap sort, an ordered
  trace). They remain available only as a non-final warm-up.
- **Low-move drag tell.** A "drag" of only 4–7 move points — just enough to clear
  a validator's move floor, versus the dozens a real ~40 Hz gesture streams —
  scores `low-move-drag` (+20 soft).

**Accessible lane — inverted so it is never the cheap door.** `accessible:true`
used to hand back a single *easy* keyboard game, so a script could request it to
dodge the visual checks. Now an accessible auth challenge is **two *normal*
`key-count` rounds** (4–5 keys, never the low-entropy 3-key), the keyboard cadence
tell is weighted **+30** so two metronomic rounds reach the block line via the
accumulator, and the lane carries a small fixed **PoW +2** (keyboard has no
pointer-physics signal, so it leans harder on the economic gate). A real
screen-reader user — whose key timing jitters — just plays two short rounds and is
never blocked. Heavier structural options (server-stepped reveal so the full
sequence never ships; render-only scenes) are deferred: on a keyboard lane stepped
reveal multiplies request count against the $0 free-tier quota for little gain
(the answer is "press the arrow shown" either way).

**Deliberately NOT done (they cost money / break $0):**
- **Payload / JS obfuscation** — nested/byte-swapped protobuf or a deploy-time
  bundle obfuscator is an obscurity treadmill: the client runs in the attacker's
  browser, so it is deobfuscated (or `fetch`-hooked / runtime-read) once and then
  parsed forever, at the cost of bundle size, client CPU, debuggability and a11y.
  Only the cheap hygiene is kept (no semantic answer fields, compact names, decoy
  fields, rounded geometry). Effort goes to protocol/economic changes instead.
- **D — Private Access Tokens** — needs an issuer (Apple/Cloudflare) or
  Turnstile (a 3rd party, which this project rejects). No clean self-hosted $0
  path.
- **E — Memory-hard PoW** — the server would have to run scrypt/Argon2 on every
  *verify*, burning Worker CPU (free tier caps it). SHA-256 keeps verify ~µs;
  the client still does the hard work, and failure escalation prices abuse.

### Performance

- The whole check (8 games + 11 themes + recorder + PoW worker) is **lazy-loaded**
  off the login/register critical path — a separate ~32 KB (10 KB gzip) chunk that
  streams in while the user reads the form (`Login.tsx`/`Register.tsx` `lazy()`).
- Each pixel sprite renders as **3 `<path>`s** (base/edge/top-bevel), not ~150
  `<rect>`s — far fewer DOM nodes on mobile.
- The decorative theme backdrop is **skipped under `Save-Data`** (flat fill instead).
- PoW runs in a Web Worker, started the instant the challenge arrives, overlapping play
  — the token is usually ready before the user submits.

## 9. Known limitations

- **Simple-shape CV.** Counting polygon vertices classifies the basic shapes
  cheaply. The geometry obfuscation raises the bar from field-read to
  perception; the real defense remains the interaction + economic layers.
- **Accessible alternative is keyboard-only, not audio.** The `key-count` game
  (the "Keyboard-only" opt-in) is non-visual + screen-reader friendly + server-
  validated, covering motor + keyboard + screen-reader users. A dedicated *audio*
  challenge for a different cohort is still possible future work.
- **Forged client evidence (the keyboard lane especially).** Telemetry is
  client-reported, so a determined script can in principle submit *plausible*
  (jittered, non-uniform) evidence. The accumulated behavioral block, no-weak-final
  pool and accessible PoW bump (§8) defeat the uniform-timing scripts seen in
  practice and raise the cost, but the structurally stronger fix — **server-stepped
  reveal** (never ship the full answer; reveal one step per round-trip) — is
  deferred because on a keyboard lane it multiplies requests against the $0 quota
  for little added security (the answer is the on-screen arrow either way). This is
  the same client-trust gap Turnstile closes only with private browser attestation.
- **PoW on very low-end devices.** Difficulty is admin-tunable; the default (16
  bits) solves in tens of ms in the Web Worker and runs in the background while
  the user plays, escalating only on failure. Extreme low-end hardware is slower.
- **No *cross-site* network reputation.** Unlike Turnstile we have no reputation
  shared across millions of other sites. Within this deployment we now keep
  per-IP **and** per-ASN abuse memory that feeds both the PoW price (escalation)
  and the risk score (Phase E reputation), plus the TLS transport cohort
  (Phase D) — together a $0 substitute. What we still can't see is an IP/ASN's
  history on *other* properties, which is the part only a network operator has.
