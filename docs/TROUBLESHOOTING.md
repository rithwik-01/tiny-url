# Troubleshooting

Symptom → cause → fix. If your issue isn't here, check the Worker logs
(`npx wrangler tail`) — `app.onError` logs the real error server-side.

---

## Setup & secrets

### Every request 500s; login fails immediately
**Cause:** `SESSION_SECRET` is missing or shorter than 32 bytes. The app asserts the secret on
startup and refuses to serve with weak crypto.
**Fix:** set a strong value (`openssl rand -hex 32` → 64 chars) in `.dev.vars` *and* via
`wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET`, then redeploy. The exact reason is in `wrangler tail`.

### `/setup` never appears, or "Setup has already been completed"
**Cause:** an admin already exists (the installer locks itself atomically after first use).
**Fix:** this is expected once you've created the admin. Log in instead. To start over you'd have
to clear the `users` table and the `setup_completed` row in `settings` (development only).

### "Invalid setup token" on `/setup`
**Cause:** the token you typed doesn't match `SETUP_TOKEN`.
**Fix:** make sure the same value is in `.dev.vars` (dev) or `wrangler secret put SETUP_TOKEN`
(prod). Re-deploy after changing a production secret.

## Domain & display

### Short links show `https://links.example.com/...`
**Cause:** `APP_URL` is still the placeholder.
**Fix:** set the `APP_URL` **env var** to your real domain (Workers Builds → Variables, or local
`.dev.vars` / `export`) and redeploy — no file edit needed. That single value configures both the
displayed origin and the Worker's route (auto-derived by `scripts/apply-domain.mjs`); there is no
separate "short domain" admin setting or `routes` block to touch.

### My custom OG image / QR logo doesn't load
**Cause:** almost always `APP_URL` being wrong, since social cards and image URLs derive from it.
**Fix:** correct `APP_URL` (above). The image itself is stored in R2 and served from `/ogimg/:id`
relative to the current origin, so once `APP_URL` is right it resolves.

---

## HTTPS, headers & cookies

### Cookies don't stick / I get logged out / headers look weak
**Cause:** the Worker is seeing plain-HTTP requests. It picks strict headers (HSTS, CSP) and the
cookie `Secure` flag based on the request being HTTPS.
**Fix:** enable **Always Use HTTPS** in *Cloudflare → your domain → SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates*.
This is a required deploy step (see [DEPLOYMENT.md → Step 7](DEPLOYMENT.md#step-7--turn-on-always-use-https--dont-skip)).

---

## Custom domains (members)

### A member's domain won't verify
**Cause (DNS mode):** the `_tiny-url-verify` TXT record isn't visible yet, or is wrong.
**Fix:** confirm the exact TXT name/value shown in the app, then wait — DNS can take minutes. The
Worker checks over public DNS-over-HTTPS, so it sees the record only once it has propagated.

**Cause (SaaS mode):** no Cloudflare API token / zone id configured, so adds fail at the API call.
**Fix:** in *admin → Settings → Custom domains*, set a token with *SSL and Certificates → Edit* and
the zone id — see [CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md](CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md) and
[CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md](CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md#part-2--member-domains).

### A verified domain resolves but shows no certificate / won't load
**Cause (DNS mode):** ownership is verified but the hostname isn't actually routed to the Worker.
**Fix:** connect it once as a free
[Workers Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/),
or use SaaS mode for fully-automatic TLS + routing.

### Unverified domains pile up
**Cause/Fix:** the daily cron removes domains left unverified past **Auto-remove unverified
domains** (admin setting, default 90 days). Set it to a smaller window, or 0 to disable.

---

## Database

### Every session-loading request 500s right after I changed the schema
**Cause:** the dev Worker hot-reloads and starts selecting new columns immediately, but the
migration hasn't run.
**Fix:** run `npm run db:migrate` (Postgres) **immediately** after editing a schema file. Always
edit **both** `schema.ts` and `schema.sqlite.ts` and generate both migrations.

### `DB_DRIVER=d1 but no D1 binding 'DB' is configured`
**Cause:** `DB_DRIVER: "d1"` is set but the `d1_databases` block is missing the `DB` binding (e.g.
you removed it, or switched a Postgres-edited config back to D1 without restoring it).
**Fix:** make sure `d1_databases` has an entry with `"binding": "DB"` and `"database_name":
"tiny-url-db"`. **No `database_id` is needed** — Cloudflare auto-provisions the DB by name on the
first `npm run deploy`.

### Postgres connection errors from the deployed Worker
**Cause:** TLS/firewall. The Worker reaches Postgres through Hyperdrive.
**Fix:** use `sslmode=require`, allow [Cloudflare's IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) on
the database, and double-check the Hyperdrive connection string. `sslmode=disable` is for local dev
only.

### The clicks table / database keeps growing
**Cause:** click history retention is off (default: keep forever).
**Fix:** set **Click history retention (days)** in *admin → Settings* (e.g. 90). A daily cron then
purges older raw rows; per-link totals are preserved regardless.

---

## Deploy & limits

### Deploy "succeeds" but the app 500s — every DB endpoint (`/api/config`, `/setup`'s data) fails **[D1]**
**Cause:** the Worker deployed, but the **D1 migrations never ran**, so the tables (e.g.
`settings`) don't exist. The usual culprit is the migrate step erroring with
**`Found a database with name or binding tiny-url-db but it is missing a database_id`** — a bare
`wrangler d1 migrations apply … --remote` can't act on a remote DB when the one-click config omits
the id (left out on purpose for auto-provisioning).
**Fix:** apply the schema with **`npm run db:migrate:d1`** (it resolves the auto-provisioned id and
applies `--remote`). On CI, make sure the **Deploy command is `npm run deploy`** (not a bare
`wrangler deploy`) — it runs that migrate automatically. Confirm with
`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://<your-host>/api/config` → expect **200**.

### `npm run deploy` fails
**Cause:** not logged in / no API token, or **[Postgres]** the Hyperdrive id is still a placeholder.
**Fix:** `npx wrangler login` (or set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — see
[CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md](CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN.md)). KV/R2/D1 **auto-provision** on first deploy, so
their ids are no longer placeholders. **[Postgres only]** if you uncommented the `hyperdrive` block,
replace `REPLACE_WITH_HYPERDRIVE_ID` with the id from `wrangler hyperdrive create`.

### The site gets slow or some things stop caching under heavy traffic
**Cause:** you're hitting a Cloudflare free-plan limit (most likely **100k Worker requests/day** or
**100k KV reads/day**). The app degrades gracefully (cache → DB → defaults) rather than erroring,
but it's a signal you've outgrown the free plan.
**Fix:** see [DEPLOYMENT.md → Scale & cost](DEPLOYMENT.md#scale--cost--what-0-really-means). For
10k+ active users, move to the Workers Paid plan ($5/month). Set a click-retention window to keep
the database small.

### A link returns a branded 404 even though it exists
**Cause:** it's paused/expired, the cache is stale, or the request host maps to a different domain
bucket than the link was created on.
**Fix:** confirm the link is active and not expired; editing/saving it re-warms the cache. Check
that the visitor's host matches the link's domain (default host vs a custom domain).

## Analytics, AI & routing

### Stats show "—" for unique visitors and the live feed is gone
**Cause:** click logging is in **rollup** mode — clicks are aggregated hourly, so per-visitor hashes
and a real-time feed don't exist.
**Fix:** expected in rollup mode (totals/breakdowns stay accurate). Switch *Admin → Click logging*
back to **raw** for uniques + live feed. Note modes don't merge history.

### I switched click-logging mode and old stats disappeared
**Cause:** raw clicks and rollups are separate stores; the dashboard reads whichever is active and
they aren't back-filled into each other.
**Fix:** pick the mode **before** heavy traffic. To keep older numbers, switch back to the mode that
holds them (per-link totals in `links.click_count` are preserved either way).

### The "AI" button just runs the plain optimizer
**Cause:** the assistant degraded to fallback — AI assistant is off in admin, the daily/hourly cap is
hit, the `AI` binding isn't present, or the model returned nothing usable.
**Fix:** enable it in *Admin → AI link assistant*; confirm the `AI` binding is in `wrangler.jsonc`;
wait out the cap. Fallback is by design, never an error.

### Country routing isn't taking effect
**Cause:** no rule matches the visitor's country, or `request.cf.country` is unknown (`XX`)/Tor
(`T1`)/missing (local dev).
**Fix:** use uppercase ISO-3166 alpha-2 codes; a country rule only fires on an exact match and takes
precedence over the per-OS targets. Everyone else gets the default destination.

## Local development

### `npm run dev` can't reach the database
**Cause:** the `CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE` in `.dev.vars` is wrong
or unset (Postgres mode).
**Fix:** set it to a working `postgres://…` URL. For a local DB without TLS, use
`sslmode=disable`. On D1 you don't need it — dev simulates D1 automatically.

### I lost my dev data after running tests
**Cause:** `npm run test:e2e` truncates **all** rows — it must only ever point at a throwaway
database.
**Fix:** always pass a disposable `DBURL=…`; never run it against the database in your `.dev.vars`.
