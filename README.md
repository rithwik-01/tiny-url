# Tiny URL — self-hosted URL shortener on Cloudflare

> **Open-source, self-hosted URL shortener & link-management platform** — a [Bitly](https://bitly.com) / TinyURL alternative you fully own. Branded short links on your own domain, a QR-code studio, bot-filtered click analytics, a REST API and an MCP server — running entirely on **Cloudflare Workers** for **$0** on the free plan.

Create short links on **your own domain** (`go.yoursite.com/<slug>`), track every click with privacy-first analytics, and let your whole team manage links from one dashboard — **no monthly SaaS bill, no vendor lock-in**.

- 🔗 **Branded short links** — random or custom back-halves, per-domain slugs, expiry, pause, tags & search, per-OS deep links, password-protected links, UTM builder, bulk CSV import
- 📊 **Privacy-first analytics** — totals, uniques, time charts, countries, referrers, device/browser/OS, live feed; bot traffic auto-excluded; CSV/JSON export
- 🎨 **QR-code studio** — frames, shapes, colors, gradients, logo library, saved presets; export PNG / SVG / JPEG
- 🤖 **REST API + MCP server** — API keys and 12 MCP tools so AI agents can manage your links
- 🛡️ **Self-hosted human check** — invisible proof-of-work + optional mini-game CAPTCHA, no third party
- 💸 **$0 on Cloudflare** — Workers + KV + R2 + (D1 or Postgres), free-tier friendly; configure everything in-app, no redeploy

## What you get

- **Links** — random or custom back-halves, expiry, pause, tags + search, per-OS deep links
  (iOS / Android / desktop), **per-country routing**, password-protected links, a UTM builder, and
  bulk import (CSV, up to 500).
- **Country routing** — send visitors from specific countries (ISO-3166) to different URLs; matched
  at the edge from `request.cf.country`, ahead of the per-OS targets. No extra service, no cost.
- **AI link assistant** — optional one-click slug + social-card (title/description) suggestions from
  the destination page, on **Workers AI** (free-tier; opt-in, admin-capped, with an offline fallback).
- **Per-domain back-halves** — slugs are unique *per domain*, so each member can run links on their
  own custom domain. Editing a back-half keeps the old one redirecting (Bitly-style retired aliases).
- **QR studio** — frames, shapes, colors, gradients, logo library, saved presets, PNG/SVG/JPEG.
- **Analytics** — totals, uniques, an adaptive time chart (hourly for 24h, daily otherwise), countries,
  referrers, device/browser/OS, live activity feed. Bot traffic is detected and excluded from every
  number. Export raw clicks as **CSV** (per link or, for admins, across everything) or the summary as JSON.
- **Built to scale on $0** — an optional **rollup logging mode** aggregates clicks through a Durable
  Object (hourly counts flushed to the DB) so a high-traffic install stays under D1's free write
  limit — no Analytics Engine, no API token, no paid tier.
- **SEO, server-rendered** — canonical, Open Graph / Twitter cards, and WebSite/Organization JSON-LD
  injected into the page `<head>`, plus `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` — all driven by the admin
  branding settings, with a one-switch indexing toggle.
- **Accounts** — email + password, server-side sessions, active-session list, soft-delete account
  closure. A **self-hosted human check** (invisible proof-of-work + optional mini-games — no third party)
  guards sign-in / sign-up.
- **Public REST API + API keys** and an **MCP server** (12 tools) so AI agents can manage links.
- **Admin console** — branding/SEO, abuse limits, custom-domain setup (with a free-tier cost cap),
  AI assistant + click-logging mode toggles, retention — **everything is configured in the app;
  nothing needs a redeploy.**

## Quick start (local, ~5 minutes)

You need **Node 22+** and a Postgres database (or use **D1** — no external DB; see below).

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars

# 2. Fill in .dev.vars — generate secrets with:  openssl rand -hex 32
#    SESSION_SECRET   = a long random string (>= 32 bytes — the app refuses to start otherwise)
#    SETUP_TOKEN      = any random token (gates the first-run installer)
#    ...HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING... = your Postgres URL

# 3. Create the database schema
npm run db:migrate

# 4. Run it (Vite + Worker together, hot-reload)
npm run dev
```

Open the app → you'll land on the **`/setup`** installer. Enter your `SETUP_TOKEN`,
create the admin account, and you're in. That's the whole local setup.

> **Prefer zero external services?** Use **Cloudflare D1** instead of Postgres — see
> [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md → Database](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#step-3--pick-your-database). Local dev simulates
> D1, KV, and R2 automatically, so `npm run dev` just works.

### Going to production

The short version: with **D1** there's nothing to provision (KV + R2 + D1 auto-create on first
deploy). `wrangler secret put` your two secrets, set an **`APP_URL`** env var to your domain (one
value — the route is derived from it, no file edits; see
**[docs/CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md](docs/CUSTOM-DOMAINS.md)**), then `npm run deploy` (it also applies the D1
schema). Full copy-paste walkthrough in **[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Local dev server (client + Worker, hot-reload) |
| `npm run build` | Build client → `dist/client`, Worker → `dist/tiny-url` |
| `npm run deploy` | Build + deploy to Cloudflare (also auto-applies D1 migrations) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check client, Worker, and Node configs |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply Postgres migrations (reads `.dev.vars`) |
| `npm run db:migrate:d1` | Apply D1 migrations `--remote` (resolves the auto-provisioned id) |
| `npm run db:generate` / `:sqlite` | Generate a Drizzle migration after a schema change (do **both**) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio |
| `DBURL=… npm run test:e2e` | Full-API integration test against a **throwaway** Postgres |

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#dev-helper-scripts) for the dev seed helpers.
